### What I learned

1. **How to make a collapsible section:**

  a. to create a nice, interactive section without writing a lot of extra code:
```html
<div class="accordion g-0" id="accordionExample">```:
 
	Here I learned:
- accordion → A Bootstrap class that makes a collapsible section (like a FAQ where you can click to show/hide answers).
- g-0 → Means "gap 0", to remove spacing between elements inside.
- id="accordionExample" → gives this section a name (ID) so JavaScript or links can control it.


  b. to keep things close together without extra gaps:
```html
<h2 class="mb-0">```:

	Here I learned:
- h2 → A heading (like a title) that is a bit smaller than h1.
- mb-0 → Means "margin bottom 0", which removes space below the heading.


2. **Using the "button" Element to Create Interactive FAQs:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-link w-100 fw-semibold" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">```:

	Here I learned:
- the <button> →  to create clickable buttons on a webpage.
- the "btn-link" → to make a button look like a link (no button style, just text).
- "w-100" → to make the button take up the full width
- "fw-semibold" → to make the text a little bold, but not fully bold.
- type="button" → to tell the browser it's a normal button (not for submitting a form).
- data-bs-toggle="collapse" → to make the button interactive, so when clicked, it shows or hides extra information (in this case, FAQ answers).
- the data-bs-target="#collapseOne" → to link the button to a section of text that will be revealed when clicked.
- aria-expanded="true" → to help screen readers know if the section is open (true) or closed (false).
- aria-controls="collapseOne" → using another accessibility helper that tells what section this button controls.

3. **Using the "span" Element for Icons Inside Buttons:**
 ```html
<span class="icon-toggle plus-icon">
    <img class="icon-plus" src="images/icon-plus.svg" alt="plus-icon">
</span>```

	Here I learned:

- the <span> element is a small, inline container that can hold text or images.
- it helps organize icons inside the button, making them easy to style separately from the text.
- the <img> inside the <span> → to display an icon, like a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.

4. **To make hidden content that appears when clicking the button:**
 ```html
<div id="collapseOne" class="collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
  <div class="card-body">...</div>```

	Here I learned:
- <div id="collapseOne"> → a section with the ID "collapseOne." This is the content that will be shown/hidden when clicking the button.
- class="collapse show" →
	collapse → means this section is collapsible (can open and close).
	show → starts open by default. if removed, the section will start hidden.
- aria-labelledby="headingOne" → to help screen readers know that "headingOne" is the title of this section.
- data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" → Makes it part of an accordion (only one section can be open at a time).
- <div class="card-body">...</div> → to hold the content inside (text, images, etc.).


6. **Using scripts to use advanced UI features in the webpage:**
  a. Pooper.js:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-I7E8VVD/ismYTF4hNIPjVp/Zjvgyol6VFvRkX/vR+Vc4jQkC+hVqc2pM8ODewa9r" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
  b. Bootstrap:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-0pUGZvbkm6XF6gxjEnlmuGrJXVbNuzT9qBBavbLwCsOGabYfZo0T0to5eqruptLy" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
	Here I learned:
- Pooper.js → to manage popups, tooltips, dropdowns, and other UI elements that need to be dynamically positioned.
- Bootstrap → to provide pre-built components and utilities, like modals, tooltips, and carousels. 

7. **Spreading items far apart inside the button:**
 ```css

button {
...
justify-content: space-between;
...
}
```
	Here I learned:
- to spread the items (like icons or text) inside the button evenly, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end

8. **Controlling how icons (like + and -) appear when clicking a button in an accordion (expand/collapse section):**
```css
.icon-toggle {
    display: inline-block;
}

.icon-minus {
    display: none;
}

.collapsed .icon-plus {
    display: inline;
}

.collapsed .icon-minus {
    display: none;
}

.btn-link:not(.collapsed) .icon-plus {
    display: none;
}

.btn-link:not(.collapsed) .icon-minus {
    display: inline;
}
```

	Here I learned:
- .icon-toggle { display: inline-block; } → to make sure icons (+ or -) are shown inline, like text.

- .icon-minus { display: none; } → to hide the minus (-) icon by default.

- .collapsed .icon-plus { display: inline; } → if the button has collapsed, the plus (+) icon is visible.

- .collapsed .icon-minus { display: none; }  → if the button has collapsed, the minus (-) icon stays hidden.

- .btn-link:not(.collapsed) .icon-plus { display: none; } → if the button is NOT collapsed, hide the plus (+) icon.

- .btn-link:not(.collapsed) .icon-minus { display: inline; } → if the button is NOT collapsed, show the minus (-) icon.


9. **Using special styling for heading four icons:**
```css
.question-3 .icon-toggle{
    position: relative;
    left: 19px;
}

.question-4 .icon-toggle {
    position: relative;
    top: -12px; }
```
	Here I learned:
- "top", "left" → to move the icon separately from the others
